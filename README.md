# Calculate_Percentage_of_5_Subjects
# Algorithm to Write C Program to Calculate Percentage of 5 Subjects
Read five subject marks and store them into 5 different variables.
Calculate the sum of all subjects and store in total = eng + phy + chem + math + comp.
Divide the sum of all subjects by the total number of subjects to find the average i.e. average = total / 5.
Calculate the percentage using percentage = (total / 500) * 100.
Finally, print resultant values total, average, and percentage.
